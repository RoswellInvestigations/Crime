## I'm on the case. Private Investigator & Detective

I‘m such a good detective, you don‘t have to find me – i find you!

### I can help you with anything

Lost your honor in the deepest dungeon? Got your local dwarf stuck in a tower while throwing him and need to blur the tracks? I can help you with that and so much more!
I will listen, review and discuss each of your issues, then make a proposal to do the investigation. I will keep close with you to ensure your issues are fully understood, and handled confidentially, effectively and "within legal parameters".

### I have already solved 56 cases so far

From finding lost adventure groups and guiding them back the way they came, to defending a knight in court for impailing a human. I've already seen it all, not even your case can ruffle me.
